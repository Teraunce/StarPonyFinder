The world is poised between many planes and they touch one another as well as Everglow itself, sometimes in sudden and dramatic upheavals that can sow chaos for weeks, months, or (rarely) years if left unchecked.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Some become exposed to this school of combat against their will, narrowly surviving an elemental bleed and<br>emerging changed for the better. Others seek out areas of intense activity, ready to harness that power and internalize the flow of planar energies. In either case they become warriors infused with the power of the cosmos, filled with the roiling power of their chosen planes.</span></p><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">Role: </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">The role of an elementalist varies depending on the element they choose and the specialities taken within, but all are capable martial combatants, be it close or at a distance. Their elemental companion can turn the tide of battle by providing a sudden flank, as well as serving as a valuable ally.</span></p><h3><span class=\"fontstyle0\">W</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size:10pt;\">eapon and </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">A</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size:10pt;\">rmor </span><span class=\"fontstyle0\">P</span><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"font-size:10pt;\">rofIcIency</span></h3><p><span class=\"fontstyle2\">An elementalist is proficient with all simple and martial weapons, and with all armor (heavy, light, and medium) and shields (not including tower shields).</span></p><h3>@UUID[Item.UYQOC0fKGZ6NfykM]{Planar Pacts}</h3><p><span style=\"font-family: 'Exo 2', sans-serif\">An Elementalist's Planar Pact determines their Planar Guide and Planar Gifts.</span></p><h3>@UUID[Item.QbH8pfjOQzBwFRXU]{Planar Guide}</h3><p>You gain a bond with an outsider.</p><h3>@UUID[Item.5RNxeAJdRjozS25N]{Summon Assistance (Su)}</h3><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">Starting at 1st level, an elementalist may call on the aid of a planar guide. Consult the planar guide chart for their statistics. A planar guide has access to all planar gifts the elementalist does. Summoning the guide is a standard action and it may be conjured anywhere within 30 feet.</span></p><h3>@UUID[Item.SoXAjCqWAJLLmIjC]{Planar Gifts}</h3><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Exo 2', sans-serif\">Planar gifts are gained from an elementalist’s chosen planar pact, granting extra abilities and their guide. Gifts with limited daily uses are drawn from the same pool, whether the elementalist or guide uses it. An elementalist can prevent a guide from activating a limited gift without effort. Unless otherwise noted, activating the power of a gift is a standard action.</span></span></p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; margin: 0.5em 0px; color: rgb(25, 24, 19); font-family: 'Exo 2', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; text-align: start\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Exo 2', sans-serif\">An Elementalist gains a Planar Gift at 1st level, 3rd level, and every 4 levels afterwards.</span></p><p style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text; margin: 0.5em 0px; color: rgb(25, 24, 19); font-family: 'Exo 2', sans-serif; font-size: 13px; font-style: normal; font-variant-ligatures: normal; font-variant-caps: normal; font-weight: 400; letter-spacing: normal; orphans: 2; text-indent: 0px; text-transform: none; white-space: normal; widows: 2; word-spacing: 0px; -webkit-text-stroke-width: 0px; background-color: rgb(242, 242, 242); text-decoration-thickness: initial; text-decoration-style: initial; text-decoration-color: initial; text-align: start\"><span class=\"fontstyle0\" style=\"box-sizing: border-box; user-select: text;\"><span style=\"font-family: 'Exo 2', sans-serif\">The base saving throw of gifts is 10 + ½ elementalist level + the elementalist’s Wisdom modifier.</span></span></p><h3>@UUID[Compendium.sfrpg.class-features.J9qk9uP3Zg8r5DO1]{Combat Feat 2nd Level}</h3><p><span class=\"fontstyle0\">At 2nd level, and at every three levels thereafter, an elementalist gains a bonus feat in addition to those gained from normal advancement.
