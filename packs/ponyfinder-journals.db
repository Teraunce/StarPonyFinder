If a tail was already present, it changes shape. Increase swimming speed by<br />10 ft.<br />11-15 Feline ears and whiskers adorn the victim, along with a +4 racial bonus to acrobatics.<br />16-20 Gorilla arms are all the rage, for at least one creature. Increase climbing speed by 10 ft.<br />21-25 Mismatched wings sprout, or existing wings become mismatched. If no wings were had before, can now<br />glide as if using </span><span class=\"fontstyle3\">feather fall</span><span class=\"fontstyle2\">. Otherwise, fly speed increases by 10 ft, but fly checks gain a -4 penalty.<br />26-30 Gain large equine ears. If such ears were already present, they double in size. Gain +2 to hearing perception checks but -2 to sonic-based saving throws.<br />31-35 Fur, hair, or scales come out in clumps, leaving bald skin behind. No bonus there, unfortunately.<br />36-40 Torso becomes sleek and snake-like, oddly long and flexible, and giving +4 to escape artist checks.<br />41-45 Tongue becomes long and lolling along with gaining the scent ability.<br />46-50 Gain the hard beak of a bird, with a bite attack to go with it. Unfortunately speaking is difficult, giving<br />spells with verbal components a 10% fail chance.<br />51-55 Gain mismatched horns. If a single horn was already present, it is pushed to the side as another mismatched partner appears. If two, one of the horns changes. Gain a gore attack if not already possessed.<br />56-60 Skin/fur, hair, and eyes change to vibrant new colors.<br />61-65 You lose a previous mutation, at random. If you had none, roll three more times on this table.<br />66-70 You sprout two new human arms.<br />71-75 Your gender is reversed. If you had no gender, flip a coin to choose one.<br />76-80 Grow huge, sharp fangs. You gain a bite attack and now require a regular meat intake. if you already<br />had fangs, they are gone, you are now herbivorous. Failure to meet your new dietary needs will result in<br />gaining the sickened condition.<br />81-85 Your legs are gone but you grow a huge snake-like tail. Movement speed is halved but you gain constrict(1d4).<br />86-90 Roll on the Everglow Reincarnation table for a whole new species and then roll again on this table.<br />91-95 Gain wings and a horn. If either was already present, you must roll again (twice if both were present).<br />The wings let you glide and your new horn gives you a single gore attack.<br />96-99 Roll twice more on this table.<br />100 GMâ€™s choice. Make sure it is something fun. If they fail to come up with anything, roll d6 more times on<br />this table.</span> <br style=\"font-style:normal;font-variant:normal;font-weight:normal;letter-spacing:normal;line-height:normal;orphans:2;text-align:-webkit-auto;text-indent:0px;text-transform:none;white-space:normal;widows:2;word-spacing:0px;-webkit-text-size-adjust:auto;-webkit-text-stroke-width:0px\" /></p>","markdown":""},"video":{"controls":true,"volume":0.5},"src":null,"system":{},"ownership":{"default":-1},"flags":{}}],"flags":{"core":{"sourceId":"JournalEntry.CW7lwc8el1GA6YJJ"}},"_stats":{"systemId":"sfrpg","systemVersion":"0.22.0","coreVersion":"10.291","createdTime":1672160121938,"modifiedTime":1673333758392,"lastModifiedBy":"7Idr7n4PmaIACOqY"},"_id":"CW7lwc8el1GA6YJJ","folder":null,"sort":0,"ownership":{"default":0,"7Idr7n4PmaIACOqY":3}}
